INTRO

kindle-newsfetch is a simple Python script which fetches calibre recipes,
turns them into Kindle newspapers using 'ebook-convert' and sends them to
the configured Kindle e-mail address using 'calibre-smtp'.

Thanks to Moritz F. Fuerst, who had the idea for this script, developed requirements,
filled and fixed bugs, contributed documentation as well as tested it extensively.

DEPENDENCIES

- Calibre command line tools (install them via calibre options dial)
